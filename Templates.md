#todo 
A Template is a `codeblock` type that contains arbitrary text that can be used to compose [Inputs](Inputs.md) and [Bindings](Bindings.md)
and then be referenced by [Actions](Actions.md). To substitute an input use the format `{{any_id}}`.

```result:template
This is the expected template where to insert {{any_id}}.
```
